KAKURO GAME INTERFACE

Kakuro, also known as Kakkuro or Kakoro, is a type of logic puzzle often likened to a mathematical version of crosswords. These puzzles are a regular feature in various math and logic puzzle publications worldwide. In 1966, Canadian Jacob E. Funk, who worked for Dell Magazines, initially coined the English name "Cross Sums" for this puzzle. Other names like "Cross Addition" have been used, but the Japanese name "Kakuro," short for "kasan kurosu" (加算クロス, meaning "addition cross" in Japanese), has become widely accepted, and most publications now refer to these puzzles using this name. Kakuro's popularity in Japan is significant, ranking second only to Sudoku among Nikoli's renowned logic puzzles.

A standard Kakuro puzzle is played on a grid with filled and barred cells, often referred to as "black" and "white" cells, respectively. Typically, these puzzles are 16x16 in size, although the dimensions may vary. Except for the top row and leftmost column, which are entirely black, the grid is divided into "entries," which are lines of white cells separated by black cells. The black cells contain a diagonal slash from the upper-left to the lower-right and one or more numbers in their halves. Each horizontal entry has a number in the black half-cell immediately to its left, and each vertical entry has a number in the black half-cell directly above it. These numbers, similar to crossword clues, are commonly known as "clues."

The goal of the puzzle is to place a digit from 1 to 9, inclusive, into each white cell so that the sum of the numbers in each entry matches the associated clue, and no digit is repeated within any entry. This absence of duplication allows for the creation of Kakuro puzzles with unique solutions. Like Sudoku, solving a Kakuro puzzle involves exploring various combinations and permutations. There is an unofficial rule in creating Kakuro puzzles that requires each clue to consist of at least two numbers that add up to it, as including only one number would make solving Kakuro puzzles mathematically trivial.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project offers multi-sized grids (3x3, 4x4 and 5x5) as well as an automatic backtracking solver.

It was made using Java, and it is inspired by the MVC design pattern

You will find the "Test" class containing the main method in the "testing" package. To run the game, simply enter the command: "java -jar <file>.jar."
